## Description

The objective of the project is to create a career services platform where students can post and update their porfolio and where employers can post job offers. We are looking to implement four types of users to populate the platform.

| Users      | Descriptions                                                                              |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student    | Students will be able to create/modify their profile and apply to job postings.           |
| Employer   | Employers will create and manage their job posts and review applications from candidates. |
| Headhunter | Headhunters will be able to recruit and direct candidate to employers based on profiles.  |
